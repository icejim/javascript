Java != javascript.
They are two very different things.

Think of the JSP lifecycle.
JSP is invoked. It runs Java/JSTL, produces an HTML page.
Java stops running.
HTML page arrives at your client. Javascript runs.
The only way to run java/jstl again is to make a request: click a link, submit a form... and get a new response.

I can't exactly figure out what you're doing there with your mix of javascript and JSTL.

You can use JSTL to produce javascript code.
For instance

function myFunction(){
  var stateArray = new Array();
  <c:forEach var="state" items="${stateList}" varStatus="status">
    stateArray[${status.index}] = "${state}";
  </c:forEach>
}

When this run it executes the JSTL and would produce something like

function myFunction(){
  var stateArray = new Array();  
  stateArray[0] = "North Carolina";
  stateArray[1] = "SouthCarolina";
  stateArray[2] = "North Dakota";
  stateArray[3] = "South Dakota";
  ...
}
